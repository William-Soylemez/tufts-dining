      Welcome to the unofficial Tufts dining website, made by me, Will Soylemez. This website was made as a project to, ideally, replace the official Tufts menu website, which is slow, hard to find, and fairly unattractive.
      <br /><br />
      To be clear, I am not associated with Tufts in any way outside of being a student here. I just take the information from their website and display it on here. I cannot guarantee the accuracy of any of the information on here either&#8212; this website will reflect what the official website says as of when I pull the information, a week before the given date, but if they change their information at the last minute or if their information is just inaccurate to begin with, my website may not reflect exactly what is actually being served.
      <br /><br />
      If you want to send me questions, feedback, or suggestions, feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:william.soylemez@tufts.edu" className="underline">william.soylemez@tufts.edu</a>.
